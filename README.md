# Course - MEM253 - Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations

Professor: Michael Plexousakis 
<br/>Applied Mathematics Department, University of Crete (Fall 2017)
<br/>Website: http://users.tem.uoc.gr/~plex/mem253-Fall2017/

## Description

The aim of the course is to study numerical methods (finite differences and finite elements) for solving some differential equations.

## Contents

I've uploaded my Python3.6 code, and the Reports in Greek (sorry for that) for each lab assignment done during the semester.
