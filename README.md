# Course - MEM253 - Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations

Professor: Michael Plexousakis 
<br/>Applied Mathematics Department, University of Crete (Fall 2017)
<br/>Website: http://users.tem.uoc.gr/~plex/mem253-Fall2017/

## Description


The aim of the course is to study numerical methods (finite differences and finite elements) for solving some differential equations.
I've uploaded my Python3.6 code, and the Reports in Greek (sorry for that) for each lab assignment done during the semester.
